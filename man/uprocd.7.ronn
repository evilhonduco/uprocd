# uprocd(7) -- Guide on managing uprocd modules with systemd

## DESCRIPTION

**uprocd** is a tool that starts processes in the background, then "freezes" them. When
you run a program using **uprocctl**(1), **uprocd** will fork the process and connect it to
the current terminal. This is essentially a form of "process caching" or "process
preloading"; processes will start more quickly, as the expensive initialization steps
have already taken place in the background.
