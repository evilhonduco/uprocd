## What is uprocd?

uprocd is a "process preloader" or "process cache" for Linux; it starts processes ahead
of time in the background, then brings forked copies to the foreground when you request
them. This means that running a command through uprocd will usually be faster than
just running it normally, since it's already been initialized.
